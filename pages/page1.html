        <p><b>SUMMER SCENERY IS LUMINOUS</b> in Yellowstone National Park, but under the surface lies an alternate reality. Photographer Brian Skerry entered the otherworldly ecosystem of Yellowstone Lake to explore unique spires formed by dormant hydrothermal vents thousands of years ago. Guiding him was Brett Seymour, pictured here, a diver and photographer for the National Park Service.</p>

        <p><u>A CHANGE OF ALTITUDE</u></p>
        <p>As a kid, Skerry opted for rock kits over chemistry sets and hoped to become a geologist. Diving amid 11,000-year-old underwater hydrothermal formations was a dream assignment. But he had just returned from chasing dolphins in South Korea and was concerned about
        swapping sea level for
        some 7,700 feet above it:
        Yellowstone is the largest lake in North America at such a high altitude. How quickly would his body-adjust? And in the depths, would he have the visibility for a good shot?</p>

        <p><b>T MINUS THREE DAYS</b></p>
        <p><u>ESSENTIAL PACKING LIST</u></p>
        To insulate himself from near-freezing water,
        Skerry wore a dry suit, which, unlike a wet suit, has room for thermal lay ers underneath. By the time Skerry dived off the boat, he was wearing a hundred pounds of gear.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A dry suit</li>
            <li>A diving harness with 30 pounds of lead weights</li>
            <li>Wool socks and thermal pants and shirt</li>
            <li>Nine portable underwater lights</li>
            <li>Eight cases of camera equipment</li>
        </ul>

        <section class="tm3">
        <p><b>T MINUS ZERO MINUTES</b></p>
        <p><u>READY FOR LAUNCH</u></p>
        Every day for a week, Skerry and Seymour would take a boat onto the lake, gear up, and roll overboard. They'd descend into what felt like a parallel universe of monochromatic shade. The water was dark and murky, so Skerry needed a lot of lighting to show a
        26-foot spire. He and Seymour brought down nine lights to set up around the spires as studio lighting. It took a week of adjustment to get the right lighting for this shot.</p>
